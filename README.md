# 3D Interactive Card Table

This is a simple interactive 3D card demo built with **Three.js**. On each page load, five random playing cards are displayed on a table. Users can:

- **Click a card** to flip it (front â†” back).
- **Hover over a card** to slightly lift it.
- **Flip all cards** at once with a button.

## Features

- Dynamic loading of card textures from `assets/images/cards/`.
- Each card maintains a `flipped` state to track orientation.
- Smooth animations using **GSAP**.
- Modular, maintainable project structure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser that supports ES modules (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Enjoy interacting with the cards.
